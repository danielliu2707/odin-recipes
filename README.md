# odin-recipes

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) and asks me to build a simple website that provides links to three different recipes.  

Through this project, I learn the basics of HTML and the website can be found [here](https://danielliu2707.github.io/odin-recipes/)
